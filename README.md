# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HudsonJunior/HudsonJunior/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Hudson Junior, a Senior Mobile Engineer from Brazil. I‚Äôm passionate about creating high-performance mobile applications and exploring innovative solutions. Connect with me on [![LinkedIn][2.2]][3].

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª A Little Bit About Me 

I‚Äôm a seasoned Mobile Engineer with over 5 years of Flutter experience, having developed numerous small to large-scale applications across startups and large organizations. Throughout my career, I've led feature deliveries, ensured adherence to architectural standards, and helped onboard new developers, especially in high-impact roles. My approach to problem-solving focuses on delivering high-quality code through thoughtful architecture and maintaining performance across large-scale applications.

I‚Äôm also an avid chess player‚Äîlet‚Äôs have a game sometime!
